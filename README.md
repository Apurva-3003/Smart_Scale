# Smart_Scale
A Program to Change the Aspect Ratio of an Image by Detecting Changes in Contour.

By generating a Pixel Energy Map, the program is able to detect dynamic changes in contour. These changes point out the important features of the pictures.
Then, by keeping the important pixels of the photo as unchanged as possible, the aspect ratio is changed whether it be from landscape to portrait mode or vice versa.
